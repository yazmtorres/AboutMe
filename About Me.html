    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a family and lifestyle photographer based in Louisville with over 10 years of experience in photography, specializing in lighting. 
Currently, I work as a contractor photographer at hospitals through Bella Baby Photography, where I edit and deliver images on the same day to fit their branded aestheticâ€”having 
processed over 14,000 images since April.</p>
<p>Beyond photography, I recently returned to Indiana University Southeast to complete my undergraduate degree in Psychology with a Marketing minor. 
    My academic journey has deepened my understanding of consumer behavior, cognitive psychology, and data-driven storytelling. Last fall, I completed my senior seminar research
     project, which was presented at the IU Undergraduate Research Conference and unexpectedly received an honorable mention. 
<p>Although I'm new to coding, I am eager to explore its applications, particularly in marketing analytics, consumer behavior research, 
    and visual data representation. I'm excited about the intersection of psychology, marketing, and technology and look forward to learning 
    how to integrate these skills into my work.</p>
